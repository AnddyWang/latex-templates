<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> is a typesetting program
used to produce high quality technical documents.
Formatting LaTeX documents is difficult and pre-built templates are
often difficult to modify.
The following are LaTeX templates I'm curating and creating
that strive to be minimalist,
which are automatically generated from the
<a href="http://github.com/bamos/latex-templates">bamos/latex-templates</a>
repository on GitHub.
See <a href="https://www.tug.org/begin.html">here</a> for a further
introduction to LaTeX.

<p>I'm two months into a CS Ph.D. program and all my LaTeX writing
is technical.
I often place the passive voice in technical documents where the active
voice better suits and have been searching for ways to automatically
prevent using the passive voice.
I recognize that using the passive voice can be favorable,
as <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/%7Egpullum/passive_loathing.pdf">this article</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_passive_voice#Advice_in_favor_of_the_passive_voice">Wikipedia</a> describe, but
I want to break my bad habit of misusing the passive voice.</p>

<p>I've found the <a href="https://github.com/btford/write-good">btford/write-good</a> project, which is a
native linter for English prose
and works well on plaintext <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> documents.
I've updated the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Makefile's</a> in this project
to use <code>write-good</code> and refuse to build documents containing passive voice.
I see forcing the active voice in LaTeX document as using the
<code>-Werror</code> flag in C and C++ programs.
All other messages are output as warnings after building.</p>

<p>Note: The return status and correct flag handling are available in my
fork at <a href="https://github.com/bamos/write-good">bamos/write-good</a>.
I've submitted a <a href="https://github.com/btford/write-good/pull/31">pull request</a> to merge these changes into
the original repository.</p>

<p>I understand this forceful option isn't desirable for everybody.
The check will run if <code>write-good</code> installed and on your <code>PATH</code>.
You can disable this check by commenting out the first call to
<code>write-good</code> in the Makefile with the <code>#</code> character.</p>
